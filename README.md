🧪 [See it live](http://sveltetailwindlte.fahiltek.co.id/)

- 🦮 Thoroughly accessible
- 🌗 Light and dark themes
- 💅 Styled with Tailwind CSS
- 🧩 Various components

## 🚀 Usage

Clone or download this repo and everything you need is inside the `public` folder.

## 🦮 Accessibility

This dashboard was developed with a11y in mind since the beginning.

1. Every text passes the WCAG Level AA (at least)
2. It is completely keyboard navigable
3. I actually used [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) to read my screen during development

Everybody can benefit with good accessibility practices, like the modal, for example ([test it live](https://windmill-dashboard.vercel.app/modals.html)). It uses focus trap techniques to not loose focus when navigating via keyboard and thinking of mobile users with large screen devices, it is placed in the bottom of the screen.

## 🌗 Multi theme

It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, and some may say it is totally biased, but it uses the most simple theming plugin there is for it, [Tailwind Multi Theme plugin](https://github.com/estevanmaito/tailwindcss-multi-theme#tailwind-css-multi-theme) (made by me). The result is that, as with regular Tailwind, you have control over every style in your pages.

You can see that by navigating through the examples, changing theme and going visiting pages like login or create account, to see different images served for different themes.

Theme auto detection based on user's OS preferences and local settings storage are enabled by default.
